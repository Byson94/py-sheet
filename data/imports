# Imports

**Description**:

Imports are the method which we use to import modules and python librarires. We use `import` to import sertain libraries and modules. We can also import only sertain functions from the module and for that, we use `from` keyword followed by the module name and then followed by the `import` keyword and the function that you want to import.

**Example**:

```python
import os # imports the os python library

from rich.console import Console # imports the console from the `rich` third party python library
```
