# loops

**Description**:

Loops are used to constantly run a block of code over and over again until the requirements are met. There are two main types of loops: `while` loops and `for` loops.

## While loops

**Description**:

A `while` loop continues to execute as long as a given condition is True. It’s useful when the number of iterations isn’t known in advance.

**Example**:

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## For loops

**Description**:

A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range). It’s great when you know exactly how many times to loop.

**Example**:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
