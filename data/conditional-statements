# Conditional statements

**Description**:

Contitional statements are blocks of code that only execute if a certain condition is met. In python we have the `if/else` statement. We can check if a certain condition is matched by doing `if <condition>` and if we want to do something else if the condition is not matched, we can use the `else` keyword to run a certain code if the condition is not met. We also have `elif`: It can be used if the main `if` block didnt trigger and we want to make another conditional check. The `else` doesnt take any condition because it runs if all the `if` and `elif` statement conditions are not met.

**Example**:

```python
condition1 = "example"
condition2 = "example"

if condition1 == "string": # checks if condition1 is true
    print("condition 1 is true!")
elif condition2 "string": # if condition1 is not met, condition2 runs
    print("condition 2  is true!")
else: # if both are not met, this is ran
    print("no conditions are true!")

# Here the condition1 and condition2 wont be true because their value is not `string` but instead `example`
```
